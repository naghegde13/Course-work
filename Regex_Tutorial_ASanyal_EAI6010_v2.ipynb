    "Regular expressions are a powerful language for matching text patterns. This tutorial gives a basic introduction to regular expressions sufficient for our Python exercises and shows how regular expressions work in Python. The Python \"re\" module provides regular expression support.Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. If you've ever used search engines, search and replace tools of word processors and text editors - you've already seen regular expressions in use. They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining."

    "    . ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \\ | ( ) (details below)\n",

    "Note that although \"word\" is the mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, \n",
    "not a whole word. \\W (upper case W) matches any non-word character.\n",
    " - \\b -- boundary between word and non-word\n",
    " - \\s -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab,\n",
    "form [ \\n\\r\\t\\f]. \\S (upper case S) matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    " - \\t, \\n, \\r -- tab, newline, return\n",
    " - \\d -- decimal digit [0-9] (some older regex utilities do not support \\d, \n",
    "but they all support \\w and \\s)\n",
    " - ^ = start, $ = end -- match the start or end of the string\n",
